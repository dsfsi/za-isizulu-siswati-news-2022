### About Dataset

Our data collection process for both isizulu and Siswati news datasets included scraping the data from internet, from Isolezwe news website [http://www.isolezwe.co.za](http://www.isolezwe.co.za) and public posts from the SABC news LigwalagwalaFM Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/ligwalagwalafm/](https://www.facebook.com/ligwalagwalafm/) respectively. 

The obtained datasets are isiZulu news articles, isiZulu news headlines, and Siswati news headlines. 

Post data collection the datasets were then sent to annotators, and they were sent back after the annotation process. The datasets contain special characters, some English words and characters that are not ASCII encoded which must be removed prior to model training. The aim of these three datasets is to create a baseline news categorisation model for the two South African low resources languages i.e. isiZulu and Siswati. 

The datasets were found to have class categories with very few observations, hence the class categories which have less than 35 observations were removed for isiZulu and less 6 observations for Siswati. 

The dataset has both full category data as well as reduced category data.

Please see the [data-statement.md](data-statement.md) for full dataset information.
